hello,

I have been studying on my own, and sometimes I feel lost in what I'm doing. I've been following a course on Udemy for about 2 weeks. I decided to change my life to focus on this, but I don't even know if I have a future in it, to be honest.
Where I have felt and continue to feel the most difficulty is in working with images without affecting the desktop and mobile sides!

I will continue to try, and if you could give me some tips, I would appreciate it! (:
